1. Take input logs from different module and feed it to AI module as input to AI.
2. Train an initial appropriate model(Deep Neural Network) using the inputs(from the other modules) and outputs(from the other modules).
3. After the initial training, adjust the hyperparameters keeping in mind the variance - bias trade off and the overall accuracy of the model.
4. Construct the final model using the data and the desired hyperparameters.
5. Validate the result on new data.
6. Deploy the model.
7. Keep adjustijng the hyperparameters after the deployment.
